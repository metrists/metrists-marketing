# Getting Started

Metrists is a Continuous Deployment pipeline for books that transforms your markdown files into beautiful web exports, with epub and audiobook formats coming soon. It makes book publishing incremental, fast, and automated.

## Creating Your First Book

### Quick Start (Recommended)

Create a new directory and start developing immediately:

```bash copy
mkdir my-book
cd my-book
touch chapter-1.md
npx metrists watch --noob
```

Metrists will automatically:
- Initialize your project with the default theme
- Create configuration files
- Start the development server
- Open your book in the browser

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
my-book/
├── .metristsrc          # Configuration file
├── meta.md              # Book metadata and description
└── chapter-1.md         # Chapter files 
```

### Book Metadata (meta.md)

The `meta.md` file is automatically created during initialization and contains your book's essential information:

```markdown
---
title: My First Book
author: Parsa
date: '2025-08-29'
tags:
  - fiction
  - adventure
---

This is the description or blurb for your book. It appears on the book's landing page and provides readers with an overview of what your book is about.

Write a compelling summary that will engage your readers and make them want to continue reading.
```

### Chapter Files

Create your book content using standard markdown files in the root directory:

```markdown
# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to my book! This is written in **markdown** and supports:

- Lists and bullet points
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Links to [other sites](https://example.com)
- Images and diagrams
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Subheading

Your content here...
```

### Adding Assets

Metrists gives you complete flexibility in organizing your assets:

#### Images
Place images anywhere and reference them with the correct path:

```markdown
# In root directory
![Cover Image](./cover.png)

# In subdirectories
![Diagram](./images/architecture.jpg)
![Screenshot](./assets/ui/screenshot.png)
```

#### Special Files
- **Favicon**: Add `favicon.ico` to the root for a custom site icon
- **Cover**: Add `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`, `cover.jpeg`, `cover.webp`, or `cover.gif` for your book cover

#### Supported Asset Types
All common file types are supported: images, PDFs, videos, audio files, etc.

## Export Formats
