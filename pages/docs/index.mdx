# Getting Started

Metrists is a Continuous Deployment pipeline for books that transforms your markdown files into beautiful web exports, with epub and audiobook formats coming soon. It makes book publishing incremental, fast, and automated.

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is with the `--noob` flag, which provides beginner-friendly output:

```bash copy
mkdir my-book
cd my-book
touch chapter-1.md
npx metrists watch --noob
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.17.0 or higher
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js

### Global Installation (Optional)

```bash copy
npm install -g metrists
```

After global installation, you can use `metrists` instead of `npx metrists`.

## Creating Your First Book

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Create a new directory and start developing immediately:

```bash copy
mkdir my-book
cd my-book
touch chapter-1.md
npx metrists watch --noob
```

Metrists will automatically:
- Initialize your project with the default theme
- Create configuration files
- Start the development server
- Open your book in the browser

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
my-book/
├── .metristsrc          # Configuration file
├── meta.md              # Book metadata and description
└── chapter-2.md         # Chapter files 
```

### Book Metadata (meta.md)

The `meta.md` file is automatically created during initialization and contains your book's essential information:

```markdown
---
title: My First Book
author: Parsa
date: '2025-08-29'
tags:
  - fiction
  - adventure
---

This is the description or blurb for your book. It appears on the book's landing page and provides readers with an overview of what your book is about.

Write a compelling summary that will engage your readers and make them want to continue reading.
```

## Writing Your Content

### Chapter Files

Create your book content using standard markdown files in the root directory:

```markdown
# Chapter 1: Introduction

Welcome to my book! This is written in **markdown** and supports:

- Lists and bullet points
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Links to [other sites](https://example.com)
- Images and diagrams
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

## Subheading

Your content here...
```

### Adding Assets

Metrists gives you complete flexibility in organizing your assets:

#### Images
Place images anywhere and reference them with the correct path:

```markdown
# In root directory
![Cover Image](./cover.png)

# In subdirectories
![Diagram](./images/architecture.jpg)
![Screenshot](./assets/ui/screenshot.png)
```

#### Special Files
- **Favicon**: Add `favicon.ico` to the root for a custom site icon
- **Cover**: Add `cover.png`, `cover.jpg`, `cover.jpeg`, `cover.webp`, or `cover.gif` for your book cover

#### Supported Asset Types
All common file types are supported: images, PDFs, videos, audio files, etc.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start Development Server

```bash
npx metrists watch --noob
```

This automatically initializes if needed and starts the development server with live reload.

### 2. Edit Your Content

Modify your markdown files and assets. Changes are automatically synchronized and the browser will refresh to show updates in real-time.

### 3. Publish When Ready

When your book is ready for the world, use the publish command to deploy it. All supported platforms come with automatic CI/CD setup, so you can just connect your Git repository and every push will trigger a new deployment.



## Publishing Your Book

Metrists supports multiple hosting platforms and handles deployment automatically:

```bash
npx metrists publish vercel
```

This will:
1. Automatically initialize if needed
2. Build your book for production
3. Create platform-specific configuration files
4. Deploy to the specified platform

### Supported Platforms

- **Vercel** - `npx metrists publish vercel`
- **Netlify** - `npx metrists publish netlify`
- **Railway** - `npx metrists publish railway`
- **Coolify** - `npx metrists publish coolify`
- **AWS S3** - `npx metrists publish s3`

*Note: Railway and Coolify both use the same underlying deployment method but are recognized as separate commands for convenience.*

## CLI Commands Reference

### Core Commands

All commands automatically initialize if the project hasn't been set up yet:

- `watch` (`w`) - Start development server with live reload
- `build` (`b`) - Build production version (requires `-o <output-dir>`)
- `publish` (`p`) - Deploy to hosting platform
- `init` (`i`) - Explicitly initialize a new Metrists project
- `prune` - Clean build artifacts

### Global Options

- `--noob` - Beginner-friendly output (recommended for new users)
- `--verbose` - Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- `--version` - Show version information
- `--help` - Show help for commands

### Examples

```bash
# Start development (auto-initializes)
npx metrists watch --noob

# Build for production (auto-initializes)
npx metrists build -o ./dist --noob

# Publish to platform (auto-initializes and builds)
npx metrists publish netlify --noob
```
