# Coolify

Deploy your book to Coolify, a self-hosted deployment solution.

```bash
npx metrists publish coolify
```

## What it does

- Creates a `nixpacks.toml` configuration file (Coolify uses Nixpacks for builds)
- Configures Coolify's build system using Nixpacks
- Sets up static file serving for your book

## Generated Configuration

Since Coolify also uses Nixpacks, it generates the same configuration as Railway with:
- Node.js provider setup
- Build phase with your book's build command
- Start command to serve static files

## Next Steps

1. Make sure you have Coolify set up on your server. If not, follow the [Coolify installation guide](https://coolify.io/docs/installation).

2. In your Coolify dashboard:
   - Create a new application
   - Connect your Git repository
   - Coolify will automatically detect the `nixpacks.toml` configuration

3. Deploy your application through the Coolify interface

Your book will be deployed on your self-hosted Coolify instance!
