# Railway

Deploy your book to Railway with simple deployment.

```bash
npx metrists publish railway
```

## What it does

- Creates a `nixpacks.toml` configuration file (Railway uses Nixpacks for builds)
- Sets up Node.js as the provider
- Configures build phases and start command
- Uses `npx serve -s` to serve your built book as a static site

## Generated Configuration

The generated configuration includes:
- Node.js provider setup
- Build phase with your book's build command
- Start command to serve static files

## Next Steps

1. Install the [Railway CLI](https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli) if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. Login to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. Initialize and deploy your project:
   ```bash
   railway link

   ```

Your book will be deployed and available at your Railway URL!
