# Vercel

Deploy your book to Vercel with zero configuration.

```bash
npx metrists publish vercel
```

## What it does

- Creates a `vercel.json` configuration file in your project root
- Sets up the build command and output directory for Vercel's deployment system
- Configures Vercel to use your book's build output for static hosting

## Generated Configuration

The generated `vercel.json` includes:
- `buildCommand`: The command to build your book
- `outputDirectory`: Where the built files are located

## Next Steps

### Deploy from GitHub

You can connect your GitHub repository to Vercel for automatic deployments on push.

import VercelDeployGenerator from '../../../components/vercel-deploy-generator'

<VercelDeployGenerator />
