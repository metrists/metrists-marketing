# Netlify

Deploy your book to Netlify with continuous deployment from Git.

```bash
npx metrists publish netlify
```

## What it does

- Creates a `netlify.toml` configuration file in your project root
- Configures Netlify's build settings and publish directory
- Sets up the build command for Netlify's continuous deployment

## Generated Configuration

The generated `netlify.toml` includes:
- `[build]` section with publish directory and build command
- Proper configuration for static site hosting

## Next Steps

1. Push your project to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign up or log in

3. Click "New site from Git" and connect your repository

4. Netlify will automatically detect the `netlify.toml` configuration

5. Deploy your site!

Your book will be automatically redeployed whenever you push changes to your repository.
