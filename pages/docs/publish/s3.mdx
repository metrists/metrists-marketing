# AWS S3

Deploy your book to Amazon S3 for static hosting.

```bash
npx metrists publish s3
```

## What it does

- Creates a [SST](https://sst.dev/) configuration to create all required resources on AWS
- Creates the GitHub Action workflow files to deploy to S3 on each push

## Generated Files

The command creates:
- SST configuration for AWS resource management
- GitHub Actions workflow for continuous deployment
- Proper S3 bucket configuration for static hosting

## Next Steps

1. Make sure you have an AWS account and have configured your AWS credentials

2. Install the [SST CLI](https://sst.dev/) if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g sst
   ```

3. Deploy your SST application:
   ```bash
   sst deploy
   ```

4. Push your code to GitHub to trigger the automated deployment workflow

Your book will be hosted on S3 and automatically updated whenever you push changes to your repository!
