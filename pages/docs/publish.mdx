# Publishing Your Book

Metrists can build a web version of your book and create the right configuration for all popular hosting providers.

```bash
npx metrists publish [host]
```

This will:
1. Build your book for production
2. Create platform-specific configuration files

## Supported Platforms

### Vercel

```bash
npx metrists publish vercel
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a `vercel.json` configuration file in your project root
- Sets up the build command and output directory for Vercel's deployment system
- Configures Vercel to use your book's build output for static hosting

The generated `vercel.json` includes:
- `buildCommand`: The command to build your book
- `outputDirectory`: Where the built files are located

### Netlify

```bash
npx metrists publish netlify
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a `netlify.toml` configuration file in your project root
- Configures Netlify's build settings and publish directory
- Sets up the build command for Netlify's continuous deployment

The generated `netlify.toml` includes:
- `[build]` section with publish directory and build command
- Proper configuration for static site hosting

### Railway

```bash
npx metrists publish railway
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a `nixpacks.toml` configuration file (Railway uses Nixpacks for builds)
- Sets up Node.js as the provider
- Configures build phases and start command
- Uses `npx serve -s` to serve your built book as a static site

The generated configuration includes:
- Node.js provider setup
- Build phase with your book's build command
- Start command to serve static files

### Coolify

```bash
npx metrists publish coolify
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a `nixpacks.toml` configuration file (same as Railway)
- Configures Coolify's build system using Nixpacks
- Sets up static file serving for your book

Since Coolify also uses Nixpacks, it generates the same configuration as Railway with Node.js provider and static file serving.

### AWS S3

```bash
npx metrists publish s3
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a [SST](https://sst.dev/) configuration to create all reqiured resources on AWS.
- Creates the Github Action workflow files to deploy to S3 on each push.
